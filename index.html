        <h2>What's new in the world of the Wasteland?</h2>
        <p> Since emerging from your Vault, you have probably wondered what the world has come to.
            <br> Well, here it is in a nutshell (or...mirelurk shell).

            <h3>Fashion</h3>
            <p>First things first, you need to know what people are wearing now a days. You don't want to be the odd one out do you?
                <br> Well...maybe you do. But! Regardless, here are the staple items you have no choice in wearing!</p>
                <article>
                    <h4>Vault Dweller Jumpsuit</h4>

                        <figcaption><i>Here are three Vault Dwellers grouped together, probably trying to figure how to escape their vault... </i></figcaption>
                        <p>This bland, but efficient piece shows your roots, where you <i>dwelled</i>, as well as your ability to live underground for and undetermined amount of time.</p>

                    <h4>Wasteland</h4>
                    <figure>
                        <img src ="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/018/678/692/large/the-friedturkey-ingame.jpg?1560288475" alt="Wasteland Outfit" height="300" width="600">
                        <figcaption><i>Pictured here is the more common trend inhabitants of the wasteland tend to wear.</i></figcaption>
                        <p>As you can see, this trend is all the rage out in most of the wasteland. A bit worn and dirty, you can style up or down, and you never have to worry about being overdressed!
                            <br> Wonderful for occasions where you need to suddenly run/escape/fight to safety. So... great for all occasions!</p>

                        <img src ="https://www.writeups.org/wp-content/uploads/Raiders-Fallout-Capital-Wasteland-c.jpg"  alt="Raider outfit" height="400" width="300">
                        <figcaption><i>This style is kinda..sorta similar to the wasteland outfit...</i></figcaption>
                        <p>This style screams "You don't want to mess with me!" while also making the onlookers scream and run in terror, or, maybe the most daring will try to fight you. <br>But with its spiked armor plates and nail embedded accessories you'll take care of those haters no problem!</p>

             <h3>Factions</h3>
             <p>Society has evolved with everything else in this new radiated world. Here are just a few of the many groups you can join.</p>
             <article>
                 <h4>Brotherhood of Steel</h4>
                 <figure>
                     <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e7/18/db/e718db0f3d9d0a34441322d0392cf6f1.jpg" alt="Brotherhood of Steel Flag" height="300" width="600">
                     <figcaption><i>Brotherhood of Steel flag displaying their sigil of patriotism</i></figcaption>
                     <p>This faction is the most patriotic, lawfully good, powerful force in the wastelands. Joining them would most certainly earn you respect with (most) people.</p>
                 </figure>
             </article>
             <article>
                 <h4>Raiders</h4>
                 <figure>
                     <img src ="https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/28659/28659-1514006237-838666186.png" alt="Raider Flag" height="300" width="600">
                     <figcaption><i>Flag of the Raiders symobolizes death and destruction.</i></figcaption>
                     <p>If you are chaotic evil, this very socially inept group of people would probably be a good fit for you. 
                         <br>This faction is great for people who want to get by the easy(ish) way by pillaging, stealing, and destroying.</p>
                 </figure>

             <article>
                 <h4>Railroad</h4>
                 <figure>
                     <img src="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/9/94/FO4_Railroad_flag.png/revision/latest?cb=20151125012055&path-prefix=ru" alt="Railroad Flag" height="300" width="400">
                     <figcaption><i>The Railroad flag symbolizes free thinking.</i></figcaption>
                     <p>The Railroad is a group who are very adamant on free thought and will. Their main focus is to help androids/&#34Synths&#34 become independant.
                         <br> If you believe in equal rights for all sentient being, these warriors of justice are for you. </p>

            <h3>Animals</h3>
            <p>Not only did the scenery change, the animals have too. These are just a few you should keep an eye out for...so they don't take your eye out.</p>
            <article>
                <h4>Radroach</h4>
            <figure>
                <img src ="https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/images/1151/49081088-1535082794.png" alt="Radroach" height="300" width="350">
                <figcaption><i>Radroach's size is demonstrated by the comparison to normal printer paper..eck!</i></figcaption>
                <p>Radroaches are unfortunately one of the least volitile radiated animals that WILL attack you. 
                        You can usually take care of these "little" guys with a simple bat, or crowbar.</p>
            </figure>

                <h4>Mirelurk</h4>
                <figure>
                    <img src ="https://www.writeups.org/wp-content/uploads/Mirelurk-Fallout-3-Firelurk.jpg" alt ="Mirelurk" height="300" width="350">
                    <figcaption><i>Mirelurks are about 5-9 ft tall, and usually reside in bodies of water.</i></figcaption>
                    <p>These creatures are pretty tough to take down. Their hard exosekelton protects them from most damage, 
                        <br>so they need to be hit in their soft underbelly where there is little protection. It is as hard as it sounds!</p>
                </figure>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>Deathclaw</h4>
                <figure>
                    <img src ="https://cdn.instructables.com/FFA/4O9Y/IN3EFGAN/FFA4O9YIN3EFGAN.LARGE.jpg?auto=webp&width=1024&height=1024&fit=bounds" alt ="Deathclaw" height="300" width="525">
                    <figcaption><i>Deathclaws will just destroy you. Just run.</i></figcaption>
                    <p>Deathclaws are about 9-12 feet tall, their claws 12 inches long, will end you with just one swipe...hence their name.
                        <br> You will feel them before you see them. No, seriously! It will feel like a small earthquake every time their massive clawed feet land on the ground.<br> So...just leave, run, save yourself and don't even attempt to take one of them down.</p>
